Modeling tool constraint :
--------------------------------

"1-N relationship" will generate intermediary collection entity.
"1-1 relationship" will reference to an entity

You can also reference conventionnaly out of the graph object by storing a reference to its UID:
Sample : "Element" can reference its "Library" by defining a property  "libraryUID"

NOT SUPPORTED :  reciprocity of relationship is currently  supported ? 
we should allow a referencing process ( if A<->B ) A should deserialze B that should reference A.


Modeling tool extensions
--------------------------------------

#1 If a property has in its userInfos dictionary a key=="type"

"type:array" this directive will cast to the native type NSArray
"type:rect" this directive will cast to the native type CGrect 
Any of the ObjectiveCHelper->getSupportedNativeTypes() types should work.


#2 If an entity has in its userInfos  a key == "generate" and a value =="collection"
It will generate an independent collection class for this object.
(Normally collection are generated according to 1-n relationships);
