Modeling tool constraint :
--------------------------------

"1-N relationship" will generate intermediary collection entity.
"1-1 relationship" will reference to an entity

You can also reference conventionnaly out of the graph object by storing a reference to its UID:
Sample : "Element" can reference its "Library" by defining a property  "libraryUID"

NOT SUPPORTED :  reciprocity of relationship is currently  supported ? 
we should allow a referencing process ( if A<->B ) A should deserialze B that should reference A.


Modeling tool extended types :
--------------------------------------

If an entity has a userInfos dictionary : 
"type:array" will cast to the native type NSArray
Sample : "Activity" references "librariesList" an array/

Any of the ObjectiveCHelper->getSupportedNativeTypes() types should work.
