Modeling tool constraint :
--------------------------------

"1-N relationship" will generate intermediary collection entity.
"1-1 relationship" will reference to an entity

You can reference an external relationship directly by using #2

NOT SUPPORTED :  automation of relationship reciprocity 
You need to manage manually reciprocity (future extension may generate setters to deal with reciprocity)


Modeling tool extensions
--------------------------------------

// Attributes or Properties 

#1 If a property has in its userInfos dictionary a key=="type" : 
"type:array" this directive will cast to the native type NSArray
"type:rect" this directive will cast to the native type CGrect 
Any of the ObjectiveCHelper->getSupportedNativeTypes() types should work.


#2 You can generate a relationship attribute adding to the property key == "relationship" value="ClassName"
This is used in WTMShelf to reference Watt classes (users=WattCollectionOfUser,...)

// Entities

#3 If an entity has in its userInfos  a key == "generate" and a value =="collection"
It will generate an independent collection class for this object.
(Normally collection are generated using to 1-n relationships);

#4 If an entity has in its userInfos  a key == "parent" and a value =="MyParent"
1- the entity prefix will not apply !!
2- this directive overrides the "parentEntity"


When using WATT framework 
--------------------------------------

You can also reference conventionnaly out of the graph object by storing a reference to its Registry identifier : uinstID
KEY FEATURE : those uinstID are persistent even when moving from a device to another.
